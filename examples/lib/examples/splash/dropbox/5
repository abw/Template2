Replace the "high school" with an 
institution which is actually a model
of adult society, in which the students
take on most of the responsibility for
learning and social life, with clearly
defined roles and forms of discipline.
Provide adult guidance, both for the 
learning, and the social structure of
the society; but keep them as far as 
feasible, in the hands of the students.
